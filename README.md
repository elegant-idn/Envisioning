# Project Miyagi - Financial coach

>  “start with the customer experience and work backwards for the technology” - Steve Jobs

This repository demonstrates the art of the possible as you modernize and transform your applications with AI.
Project Miyagi is embedded with intelligence and built on a scalable event-driven architecture, 
leveraging innovative programming paradigms such as
prompt engineering, prompt chaining, embeddings, conversational memory stores, and nascent technologies like
[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain#readme),
as well as Foundation Models from Azure OpenAI and 
[Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-a-renaissance-in-computer-vision-ai-with-microsofts-florence-foundation-model).

With a focus on customer-centricity, Project Miyagi challenges you to rethink how AI can elevate and hyper-personalize your 
customers' experiences, whether it's a line-of-business (LOB) or consumer-facing app.
It includes real-world customer use cases and pain points in the financial sector, 
providing an easily understandable scenario for gaining valuable insights.

This polyglot codebase relies on a scalable event-driven backend and a multitude of microservices, 
choreographing retail and high-frequency trading,
generating AI for personalized financial coaching and agent-like orchestration, and building on a solid EDA backbone to ensure enterprise-grade quality attributes such as availability, scalability, and maintainability.

Take the first step towards transforming your applications into cutting-edge, intelligent systems with the self-guided workshop.
