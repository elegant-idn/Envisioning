# Project Miyagi - Financial coach

>  “start with the customer experience and work backwards for the technology” - Steve Jobs

This is a sample repo to showcase the art of the possible to modernize and transform your applications with embedded intelligence and scalable event-driven architecture. As always, start with your customers and rethink how AI could augment and hyper-personalize their experiences, whether it's for a line-of-business (LOB) or consumer-facing app. 

Project Miyagi is a case study, incorporating our customer use cases and pain-points in the financial sector. However, it's an easy-to-understand scenario to find insightful as you rethink UX and re-architect your backend to design a system with enterprise-grade quality attributes. <TODO>

The backend of this polyglot codebase comprises several microservices to choregraph retail and high-frequency trading, generative AI for personalized financial coaching, and agent-like orchestration, all with a EDA backbone to ensure availability, scalability, and maintainability. <TODO>
